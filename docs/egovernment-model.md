# Ephemeral E-Signature: A Single-Use Digital Signature Protocol Challenging Cryptographic Orthodoxy

## Abstract

This paper introduces the revolutionary **Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol**, which challenges one of the fundamental dogmas of the cryptography community: the principle that "the user must possess their private key." In traditional e-signature systems, users reuse the same private key for years, must store these keys on special devices such as USB tokens or smart cards, and are required to carry, protect, and back them up continuously. This approach creates both technical and operational burdens for users and poses a serious risk: if the key is ever stolen, the attacker completely takes over the victim’s digital identity.

Our proposed protocol solves this problem at its root: users never own a private key, carry no cryptographic device, and simply access the e-government system using two-factor authentication on their mobile devices. For each transaction, one-time private keys are generated by the institutional infrastructure, used solely for that transaction, and securely destroyed once the operation is complete.

Our protocol introduces three key innovations:

1. **Zero-Key User Model** – the user only receives the signed document and never owns a private key.
2. **Institutional One-Time Key Generation** – for every transaction, both the institution and the e-government system generate their own one-time key pairs, which are valid only for that specific transaction and cannot be used elsewhere.
3. **Target-Locked Signing** – the generated signature can only be used by the requesting institution and cannot be opened by other parties.

Our security analysis shows that the protocol eliminates the fundamental security risks of traditional systems: the risk of user device compromise is zero, the impact of institutional data breaches is limited to a single session, and replay attacks are impossible. The system uses a four-party verification mechanism coordinated by the National Telecommunications Authority (NTA) and generates unique tokens for every transaction.

This work proposes a paradigm shift in cryptographic philosophy by replacing the question "who controls the private key?" with "does the user actually need a private key?" From a legal perspective, it highlights the need to update current e-signature legislation, while from a technical standpoint, it offers a fully secure and practically deployable alternative.

## 1. Introduction

Electronic signature systems have become one of the foundational infrastructure components of modern digital society. From banking transactions to government services, from commercial contracts to health records, e-signature technology affects the daily lives of millions of users. However, current e-signature systems present significant challenges for both users and institutions.

### 1.1 Key Problems of Current E-Signature Systems

#### Problems from the User Perspective

**Technical Complexity and Device Dependency:** Today, a person who wants to use e-signatures must purchase a special hardware device (USB token, smart card), carry it constantly, and keep it safe. In case of loss or malfunction, obtaining a replacement device and reinstalling the software is both time-consuming and costly.

**Security Burden:** Users are fully responsible for the security of their private keys. They must remember their PIN codes, protect their devices from malware, and prevent unauthorized access. This responsibility often exceeds the average user’s technical knowledge and experience.

**Cross-Platform Issues:** Compatibility problems occur across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and browsers. Users often have to deal with driver installation, certificate management, and other technical setup tasks.

#### Problems from the Institutional Perspective

**Wide-Scale Breach Risk:** If a user’s private key is compromised, not only the current transaction but also the user’s entire digital identity and all past transactions are at risk. Since a single private key may be used for years, one breach can lead to catastrophic damage.

**Support and Maintenance Overhead:** Institutions must provide ongoing technical support for users’ device issues, installation problems, and driver updates. This creates both financial and operational complexity.

**Legal and Compliance Ambiguities:** Since the security of the private key is outside institutional control, the burden of proof becomes more complicated in legal disputes.

### 1.2 Cryptographic Orthodoxy and the Need for Alternative Thinking

Current e-signature systems are based on the principle that "the user must always have their own private key." This stems from the direct application of cryptographic principles developed in the 1980s and 1990s. The prevailing philosophy of that era — "don’t trust, verify" — assumed that every user must control their own cryptographic material.

However, this orthodox approach does not align with the realities of modern digital life:

* **Lack of Technical Expertise:** Millions of ordinary users lack the technical knowledge required for cryptographic key management.
* **User Experience Problem:** Complex security procedures drive users away from the system or lead to insecure behavior.
* **Scalability Issue:** Providing technical support to millions of users at an institutional level is unsustainable.

### 1.3 Purpose and Contribution of the Study

This study questions the fundamental assumptions of existing e-signature systems and proposes an alternative approach. Our core research question is: *"Does the user really need to own a private key, or is simply possessing the signed document sufficient?"*

**Our main contributions are:**

1. **Paradigm Shift:** A new security model focusing on "ownership of the result" rather than "ownership of the key."
2. **Practical Solution:** A system that frees users from technical complexity and requires only a mobile device.
3. **Security Enhancement:** Elimination of fundamental security flaws of traditional systems through one-time keys.
4. **Institutional Efficiency:** Reduced support costs and more reliable processes.

### 1.4 Structure of the Paper

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 critiques cryptographic orthodoxy and discusses the proposed paradigm shift. Section 3 reviews related work. Section 4 presents the technical details of the Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol. Section 5 provides the security analysis. Section 6 covers legal compliance and implementation considerations. The final section concludes with results and future research directions.

## 2. Challenging Cryptographic Orthodoxy: Paradigm Shift

### 2.1 Established Dogmas of the Cryptography Community

Modern cryptography has been built for decades on certain fundamental principles that have gone largely unquestioned. These principles stem from the direct application of public-key cryptography theories that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s and have taken on an almost dogmatic status:

**"Don’t Trust, Verify" Principle:** This principle asserts that no central authority should be trusted and that every transaction must be independently verified. While valuable as a defense mechanism against state surveillance and censorship in the 1970s and 1980s, it is not always suitable for today’s digital service needs.

**"If the Keys Aren’t Yours, the Security Isn’t Yours" Maxim:** Emerging from the crypto-anarchist tradition, this view holds that cryptographic material must remain under the exclusive control of the user. This philosophy is widely embraced in blockchain and cryptocurrency communities.

**"Centralization Equals Vulnerability" Assumption:** There is a prevailing belief that centralized systems are inherently insecure and that distributed systems are always safer.

### 2.2 Contemporary Limitations of the Orthodox Approach

While these orthodox principles made sense in the technological and social context of their time, they increasingly clash with the realities of the 21st century:

#### Unrealistic Assumption of Technical Expertise

Cryptographic orthodoxy assumes that every user has the technical capacity to manage their own security. In reality, this is not true for millions of ordinary users. Key management, secure storage, backup, and recovery are processes far beyond the knowledge and experience of most users.

#### Ignoring the Scalability Problem

A user-centric security model might work for small communities, but it is unsustainable for systems with millions of users. Requiring every user to manage their own cryptographic device creates significant operational overhead for both users and service providers.

#### Failure to Overcome the Security–Usability Tradeoff

The current orthodox approach assumes that security and usability are mutually exclusive. Increasing security decreases usability, and increasing usability introduces security risks. This tradeoff severely limits the adoption of technology at scale.

### 2.3 Temporal Security Revolution: A New Paradigm

This study proposes a paradigm shift that reconceptualizes cryptographic security from the ground up. We change the fundamental question:

**Old Question:** "Who controls the private key?"
**New Question:** "Does the user actually need control over the private key?"

#### Result-Focused Security Model

What users really need is not cryptographic capability but cryptographic outcome. A user who wants to sign a document does not truly want "the capacity to produce signatures"—they want "a signed document." This distinction opens the door to a radically different security model.

**Traditional Approach:** User → Private Key Owner → Unlimited Signature Production Capacity
**New Approach:** User → Transaction Request → Specific Signed Document

#### Security Superiority of One-Time Use

In traditional systems, a private key is used for years and remains at risk for the entire duration. The one-time approach eliminates this risk completely. A private key is generated, used, and retired solely for a specific transaction. Its security advantages include:

* **Zero Long-Term Risk:** There is no long-lived key to steal.
* **Limited Blast Radius:** A single compromise affects only one transaction.
* **Automatic Security Refresh:** The most up-to-date security parameters are used for every transaction.

### 2.4 Advantages of Institutional Security Infrastructure

Cryptographic orthodoxy is often biased against institutional security infrastructure. Yet, an objective assessment shows that professional security infrastructure can outperform individual security efforts:

#### Professional vs. Amateur Security Management

**Institutional Security Infrastructure:**

* 24/7 Security Operations Centers
* Professional-grade Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
* Regular security audits and certifications
* Multiple backups and disaster recovery systems
* Expert security personnel

**Individual User Security:**

* Limited technical knowledge and experience
* Consumer-grade security solutions
* Irregular backups and updates
* A single person bearing all responsibility

#### Temporal Institutional Trust Model

Our new paradigm defines institutional trust as "temporal" rather than "perpetual." The user does not grant unlimited trust to the institution but only for a limited time and for a specific transaction. This model offers the following benefits:

* **Limited Trust Duration:** Measured in minutes or hours, not years.
* **Transaction-Specific Authorization:** Valid only for the requested operation.
* **Automatic Trust Expiration:** Trust relationship ends as soon as the transaction is complete.

### 2.5 The Necessity of Paradigm Shift

#### Institutional Infrastructure in the Post-Quantum Era

The looming threat of quantum computing will make individual cryptographic management even more difficult. Post-quantum algorithms require larger keys and more complex processes. Expecting millions of ordinary users to handle this complexity is unrealistic. Professional, institution-level cryptographic infrastructure will become indispensable.

#### Digital Inclusion and Social Accessibility

For digital services to reach all segments of society, technological complexity must be abstracted away from the users. Elderly people, children, individuals with disabilities, and millions without technical knowledge should be able to benefit from digital services without dealing with complicated cryptographic operations.

#### A Sustainable Security Model

The current orthodox approach is not sustainable. Security breaches caused by user error, rising technical support costs, and growing system complexity all indicate that change is necessary. The new paradigm addresses these issues at their root and offers a more sustainable model.

### 2.6 Expected Criticisms from Orthodoxy and Our Responses

#### "Isn’t This Just Centralization?" Criticism

**Orthodox View:** Institutional key generation creates centralization, which is a vulnerability.

**Our Response:** Minutes of temporal centralization are preferable to decades of personal vulnerability. Thirty minutes of professional security management is safer than thirty years of amateur efforts.

#### "Users Must Control Their Own Keys" Criticism

**Orthodox View:** Users must own and control their cryptographic material.

**Our Response:** Users should be secure, not burdened. What users need is not "control capacity" but "secure outcomes." Offloading cryptographic complexity from users does not reduce security — it reduces risk.

#### "Institutions Cannot Be Trusted" Criticism

**Orthodox View:** Central authorities are inherently untrustworthy and prone to abuse.

**Our Response:** Transaction-specific trust that lasts minutes is far more controllable than perpetual key ownership risk. In everyday life, people already trust institutions with identity, taxes, and health records. Short-term cryptographic trust is not a philosophical surrender but a pragmatic evolution.

## 3. Related Work and Current State of Technology

### 3.1 Traditional Electronic Signature Systems

#### PKI-Based E-Signature Infrastructures

Current electronic signature systems are largely based on the X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model. In these systems, users possess long-term private keys certified by Certificate Authorities (CAs). In Turkey, providers such as E-Güven and TURKTRUST follow this model.

**Core Components of PKI Systems:**

* Certificate Authorities (CA): Trusted entities that issue signature certificates
* Registration Authorities (RA): Intermediaries that perform user identity verification
* Certificate Repository: Central system where valid certificates are stored
* Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL): Lists of certificates that have been revoked

**Limitations of the PKI Model:**

The management of long-term key lifecycles is the weakest point of PKI systems. Users’ private keys are typically valid for 1–3 years and remain at risk for the entire duration. If a key is compromised, not just the current transaction but all transactions performed during the key’s validity period are subject to doubt.

#### Hardware-Based Security Solutions

Smart cards, USB tokens, and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) were developed to securely store private keys. These devices provide tamper-resistant protection by preventing private keys from leaving the device.

**Advantages of Hardware Solutions:**

* Physical protection of the private key
* PIN-based access control
* Certificate and key lifecycle management

**Disadvantages of Hardware Solutions:**

* High cost (device, license, maintenance)
* Complexity in user experience
* Platform dependency and driver issues
* Risk of physical loss or theft

### 3.2 Work on Ephemeral Cryptography

#### Forward Secrecy Protocols

Forward secrecy is a cryptographic property that protects past sessions even if long-term keys are compromised. It is widely used in protocols such as TLS, SSH, and Signal.

**Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) and Elliptic Curve DHE (ECDHE):**
These protocols generate temporary key pairs for each session and erase them at the end of the session, ensuring that past sessions remain secure even if the main key is compromised.

**Signal Protocol:**
The Double Ratchet protocol used in messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal generates new ephemeral keys for each message, achieving message-level forward secrecy.

#### Ephemeral Key Infrastructures (EKI)

The academic literature contains limited work on ephemeral key infrastructures, and most focus on secure communication protocols.

**Bonneau et al. (2014)** proposed ephemeral key management for web applications, but this was focused on encryption rather than digital signatures.

**Ryan and Tews (2019) proposed a “Session-Specific PKI”** approach that is closest to our work, but it still requires users to play an active role in generating ephemeral keys.

### 3.3 Post-Quantum Cryptography and E-Signature

#### Quantum Threat and the Future of Current Systems

Shor’s algorithm poses a potential threat to RSA, ECDSA, and other existing public-key cryptosystems. The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process aims to develop alternative algorithms resistant to quantum attacks.

**Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms:**

* CRYSTALS-Dilithium: Lattice-based digital signature
* FALCON: Compact lattice-based signatures using NTRU
* SPHINCS+: Stateless hash-based signatures

**Challenges of Post-Quantum Algorithms for E-Signature:**

* Larger key sizes (2–8 KB vs. current 256–512 bytes)
* Slower computation times
* More complex parameter management
* Increased storage requirements

These challenges further increase the difficulty of individual key management and reinforce the need for institutional infrastructure in the post-quantum era.

### 3.4 Mobile Authentication and E-Signature Solutions

#### Mobile Signature Systems

In Turkey, mobile signature services provided by Turkcell, Vodafone, and Türk Telekom use SIM card-based identity verification. These systems, similar to our approach, do not require users to carry a separate physical token.

**Advantages of Mobile Signatures:**

* No need for physical tokens
* SMS-based second-factor authentication
* Security based on telecommunication infrastructure

**Limitations of Mobile Signatures:**

* Limited security level of SIM cards
* Dependence on mobile operators
* Vulnerabilities of SMS security (e.g., SIM swap attacks)
* Debated legal evidentiary strength

#### FIDO/WebAuthn Standards

The WebAuthn standard, developed by the FIDO Alliance, uses ephemeral cryptographic signatures for passwordless authentication. A new challenge–response pair is generated for each authentication event.

**Key Features of the FIDO Approach:**

* Integration with biometric authentication
* Unique challenge for each transaction
* Temporary keys between client and server
* Privacy-preserving design

While FIDO shares principles similar to our proposal, it is limited to authentication and does not generate legally valid electronic signatures.

### 3.5 Blockchain and Distributed E-Signature Approaches

#### Blockchain-Based Digital Signature Systems

Platforms such as **DocuSign Agreement Cloud** and **Adobe Sign** have started to leverage blockchain technology for signature verification and data integrity. However, these approaches still rely on the traditional PKI model.

**Ethereum-Based Digital Signature Projects:**

* uPort: Decentralized digital identity
* Civic: Blockchain-based identity verification
* SelfKey: Self-sovereign identity management

**Limitations of Blockchain Approaches:**

* High energy consumption
* Scalability issues
* Complex user experience
* Legal uncertainties

### 3.6 Our Distinction from Existing Work

#### Originality of Our Approach

Our literature review indicates that our proposed “Zero-Key User E-Signature Model” has not been comprehensively explored in academic research. Existing work remains limited in the following areas:

**Ephemeral Key Studies:** Mostly focused on communication security, with limited application to digital signatures.

**Mobile Signature Studies:** SIM card-based solutions with lower security guarantees.

**Post-Quantum Research:** Focused on algorithm development, overlooking user experience.

**Blockchain Studies:** Technology-driven, with practical deployment challenges.

#### Our Innovative Contributions

1. **User Never Owns a Key:** No existing system fully applies this principle.
2. **Institutional Ephemeral Key Generation:** Both the institution and e-government generate one-time keys for each transaction.
3. **Four-Party Security Verification:** Multi-token system under NTA coordination.
4. **Target-Locked Signing:** Signature can only be used by the requesting institution.
5. **Mobile-Only User Experience:** Authentication with just a phone and two-factor verification.

This combination of features forms a unique approach with no direct equivalent in the current literature.

## 4. Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol Design

### 4.1 Fundamental Principles of the Protocol

The Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol is built on three core principles:

1. **Zero-Key User Principle:** The user never owns a private key.
2. **One-Time Key Principle:** All private keys are generated solely for a specific transaction.
3. **Distributed Verification Principle:** Security relies on multi-institution coordination.

### 4.2 System Components

#### 4.2.1 Main Actors

**User:** The person requesting the transaction. Performs authentication only via a mobile device.

**Institution:** The organization requesting the e-signature service (bank, hospital, notary, etc.). Generates a one-time key pair for each transaction.

**E-Government:** The central coordinator and identity verification authority. Generates a transaction-specific ephemeral key pair and performs the signing operation.

**NTA (National Telecommunications Authority):** Acts as a zero-knowledge bridge. Distributes tokens to all parties simultaneously.

**E-Signature Provider:** Trusted service provider that issues certificates. Works with saddle-encrypted data and does not see any party’s private information.

#### 4.2.2 Cryptographic Components

**KPubK/KPriK:** Institution-generated one-time key pair
**ePubK/ePriK:** E-Government-generated one-time key pair
**Token-User:** Authentication token given to the user
**Token-eGov:** Coordination token given to the e-government
**Token-CA:** Certification token given to the e-signature provider
**Token-Institution:** Approval token given to the institution

### 4.3 Protocol Flow Details

#### Phase 1: Institution Request Creation

**Step 1:** The user physically visits the institution and requests a transaction (e.g., opening a bank account, signing an insurance policy).

**Step 2:** The institution initiates a special process for this user:

* Generates a cryptographically secure one-time key pair: `KPriK` (private) + `KPubK` (public)
* Notifies the e-government system: “Create a transaction request for User X”
* Sends `KPubK` together with transaction details to the e-government
* Transaction validity period: 1 hour

#### Phase 2: User Transaction Selection

**Step 3:** The user logs in to the e-government portal via mobile:

* Two-factor authentication (National ID + SMS/Mobile Signature)
* Optional biometric authentication (fingerprint/face recognition)

**Step 4:** The e-government system displays the “Pending Transactions” menu:

* Shows institution name, transaction type, and details
* User can review transaction details

**Step 5:** The user selects and approves the transaction:

* E-government cross-validates `KPubK` with the user’s identity information
* Confirms transaction-user matching

#### Phase 3: Temporary E-Signature Creation

**Step 6:** E-government notifies NTA of the transaction request:

* Sends transaction ID, user reference, and institution details
* NTA generates a unique transaction reference

**Step 7:** NTA distributes tokens simultaneously:

* `Token-User` → to the user (via e-government)
* `Token-eGov` → to the e-government
* `Token-CA` → to the e-signature provider
* `Token-Institution` → to the institution
* All tokens include the same transaction reference and can be cross-validated

**Step 8:** E-government generates its own ephemeral key pair:

* Securely generates `ePriK` (private) + `ePubK` (public)
* Encrypts user identity data and transaction details using `ePubK`
* Creates a digital signature using `Token-eGov`
* Sends encrypted package + digital signature + `Token-eGov` to the e-signature provider

**Step 9:** The e-signature provider performs validation and certification:

* Matches `Token-eGov` with its own `Token-CA`
* Approves the process if matched, rejects otherwise
* Verifies the digital signature
* Issues an e-signature certificate for the user
* Encrypts the certificate with `ePubK` and sends it back to the e-government

**Step 10:** E-government performs the final operation:

* Decrypts the encrypted package using `ePriK`
* Verifies the e-signature certificate
* Signs the document with its own `ePriK`
* Encrypts the signed document with `KPubK` and sends it to the institution

#### Phase 4: Institution Verification and Completion

**Step 11:** The institution performs final verification:

* Decrypts the encrypted package using `KPriK`
* Confirms the transaction matches its original request
* Accesses user identity information and e-signature
* Executes the process (e.g., account creation, policy activation)

**Step 12:** User receives result notification:

* Informed about the completion status
* Provided with a copy of the signed document if needed

*Figure 1: Full Flow Diagram of the Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol*
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

### 4.4 Technical Details of Security Features

#### 4.4.1 Dual Ephemeral Key Protection

The protocol uses one-time key pairs at two points:

**E-Government Side (`ePriK`/`ePubK`):**

* Used for secure communication with the e-signature provider
* Can be wiped from memory after transaction completion (optional)
* Even if compromised, valid only for that single transaction

**Institution Side (`KPriK`/`KPubK`):**

* Used for secure communication with the e-government
* Can be wiped from memory after transaction completion (optional)
* Even if compromised, valid only for that single transaction

#### 4.4.2 Token-Based Cross-Validation

Tokens distributed by NTA provide the following security layers:

**Simultaneous Distribution:** All parties receive tokens simultaneously, preventing precomputation attacks.

**Unique Transaction Reference:** Each token set is valid only for a single transaction.

**Cross-Validation:** Each party verifies incoming requests using its own token.

**Replay Attack Protection:** Tokens cannot be reused for subsequent requests.

#### 4.4.3 Encryption Chains

Data passes through multiple encryption layers:

**Layer 1:** E-signature provider → encrypts with `ePubK`
**Layer 2:** E-government → decrypts with `ePriK`, re-encrypts with `KPubK`
**Layer 3:** Institution → decrypts with `KPriK`

This chain ensures data confidentiality even if a single point is compromised.

### 4.5 Error Handling and Exceptional Cases

#### 4.5.1 Timeout Scenarios

**Institution Token Expiry (1 hour):**

* Transaction is automatically canceled
* User may reapply
* System securely clears logs

**NTA Token Expiry (30 minutes):**

* Active transaction is canceled
* All parties are notified of cancellation
* User may start a new transaction

#### 4.5.2 Network and System Failures

**E-Government System Failure:**

* Transaction is temporarily paused
* User is informed
* Process resumes after system recovery

**NTA Failure:**

* New transactions cannot be initiated
* Ongoing transactions are completed if possible
* Backup NTA systems may be activated

**E-Signature Provider Failure:**

* Transaction may be redirected to an alternate provider
* User is informed and consent is requested

### 4.6 Performance and Scalability

#### 4.6.1 Transaction Time Analysis

**Typical Transaction Time Breakdown:**

* User authentication: 30–60 seconds
* NTA token distribution: 2–5 seconds
* Key pair generation: 1–3 seconds
* E-signature certification: 5–10 seconds
* Encryption/decryption operations: 1–2 seconds
* **Total time: 45–85 seconds**

#### 4.6.2 System Capacity

**NTA Token Generation:** 10,000+ simultaneous tokens per second
**E-Government Key Generation:** 1,000+ key pairs per second
**E-Signature Provider Certification:** 50,000+ certificates per minute

These capacities are sufficient to handle the daily e-signature demand of an entire country like Turkey.

## 5. Security Analysis

### 5.1 Threat Model

To analyze the security of the Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol, we define the following threat scenarios:

**T1: External Attacker** – An adversary launching attacks from outside the system over the network
**T2: Compromised Infrastructure** – Partial security breach of system components (e-government, institution, NTA)
**T3: Malicious Insider** – Insider threats with administrator-level access to system components
**T4: Network-Level Attacker** – Man-in-the-middle attacks that intercept or disrupt communications
**T5: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** – Long-term, sophisticated attack campaigns

### 5.2 Security Comparison with Traditional Systems

#### 5.2.1 Private Key Compromise Scenario

**Traditional E-Signature System:**

```
If a user’s 3-year private key is stolen:
→ Attacker can generate unlimited fake signatures for 3 years
→ All past signatures are put into question
→ Authorization for new signatures continues
→ Revocation process is complex and time-consuming
```

**Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol:**

```
If a one-time private key is stolen:
→ Attacker can only sign that specific document
→ Cannot be used for any other document
→ Past signatures remain unaffected
→ Future transactions remain secure
→ No revocation needed (expires automatically)
```

#### 5.2.2 System Compromise Impact Analysis

| Attack Target          | Traditional System                      | Temporary E-Signature                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User Device            | Critical (all keys at risk)             | No impact (no keys stored)            |
| CA Servers             | High (certificate authority compromise) | Low (one-time certificates)           |
| Institution Systems    | High (user keys may be accessible)      | Low (limited to a single transaction) |
| Central Infrastructure | Critical (system-wide failure)          | Medium (new transactions halted only) |

### 5.3 One-Time Key Security Analysis

#### 5.3.1 Key Lifecycle Security

**Key Generation:**

* Uses cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG)
* Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration recommended
* Multiple entropy sources utilized

**Key Usage:**

* Restricted to a specific transaction and document
* Cross-domain usage prevented (target-locked signing)
* Time-stamped to limit scope

**Key Destruction:**

* Secure memory wiping after transaction (optional but recommended)
* Protection against swap/hibernation leaks
* TRIM/secure erase commands for SSDs

#### 5.3.2 Resistance to Attack Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Malware Infection on User Device**

```
Traditional: Keylogger steals private key PIN → Full compromise
Temporary: No private key to steal → Zero impact
```

**Scenario 2: Institutional Data Breach**

```
Traditional: User keys may be stolen → Identity theft
Temporary: Only transaction results are stored → Cannot generate new signatures
```

**Scenario 3: Network Sniffing/Interception**

```
Traditional: Key or PIN could be captured in transit
Temporary: Only encrypted data and tokens present → No meaningful information leaked
```

### 5.4 Distributed Security System Analysis

#### 5.4.1 Multi-Token Verification Security

The protocol enforces multi-party verification by distributing tokens to four independent entities simultaneously:

**Attacker’s Success Conditions:**

1. Must capture all four token sets
2. Must breach each institution’s internal systems
3. Must break token matching algorithms
4. Must achieve all this within a 30-minute window

**Mathematical Success Probability:**

```
P(success) = P(T1) × P(T2) × P(T3) × P(T4) × P(time)
```

Even assuming a generous 10% success probability per step:

```
P(success) = 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.00001 (0.001%)
```

#### 5.4.2 NTA Single Point of Failure Analysis

**Risk:** A full compromise of the NTA could affect the system.

**Mitigating Factors:**

* NTA only coordinates, never sees private keys
* Token generation is non-deterministic and unpredictable
* NTA compromise only affects new transactions, not historical ones
* Redundant NTAs and geographic distribution reduce risk

**Recommended NTA Security Architecture:**

```
Primary NTA (Istanbul) ↔ Secondary NTA (Ankara) ↔ Backup NTA (Izmir)
└── Cryptographic sync and validation ──┘
```

### 5.5 Cryptographic Security Evaluation

#### 5.5.1 Encryption Algorithm Security

**Supported Algorithms:**

* RSA-2048/4096: Adequate for current standards
* ECDSA P-256/P-384: Mobile-friendly and efficient
* Post-Quantum Ready: CRYSTALS-Dilithium integration possible

**Encryption Chains:**

```
Data → Encrypt with ePubK → Encrypt with KPubK → Secure transmission
```

This double-encryption protects against single-key compromise.

#### 5.5.2 Hashing and Integrity Protection

**Digital Signature Integrity:**

* SHA-256/SHA-3 hash functions
* HMAC-based message authentication
* Timestamp authority integration

**Replay Attack Protection:**

* Unique nonce values
* Token-based replay prevention
* Strict time window enforcement

### 5.6 Legal and Compliance Security

#### 5.6.1 Non-Repudiation

**Security Chain:**

1. User physically applies to institution and passes strong identity verification (application record)
2. Logs in to e-government via mobile identity verification (digital trace)
3. Explicitly selects and approves the transaction (user consent)
4. NTA token coordination (timestamp)
5. Certification by e-signature provider (trusted third party)

This chain legally invalidates any claim of “that is not my signature.”

#### 5.6.2 Evidence Preservation

**Logs to Retain:**

* User authentication records
* NTA token generation and distribution logs
* Transaction timestamps and hash values
* E-signature provider certification logs

**Log Security:**

* Immutable blockchain-based log system
* Multi-geographic redundancy
* Cryptographic hash chains for tamper protection

### 5.7 Performance and Security Balance

#### 5.7.1 Security vs. Speed Tradeoff

**Use Cases Requiring Speed:**

* Emergencies (healthcare, financial crises)
* High-volume events (tax season)

**Security Optimizations:**

* Parallel key generation
* Cache-based token validation
* Load balancing for system distribution

#### 5.7.2 Usability Security

**Preventing User Errors:**

* Simple, clear user interface design
* Automatic process guidance
* Clear feedback on errors

**Social Engineering Protection:**

* Transparent display of transaction details
* Delay/wait times during approval steps
* Suspicious transaction detection and warning system

### 5.8 Security Metrics and Success Criteria

#### 5.8.1 Measurable Security Indicators

**Target Figures:**

* Successful attack rate: <0.001%

This security analysis demonstrates that the Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol provides significant security advantages over traditional systems.

## 6. Legal Compliance and Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Current E-Signature Legislation and Compliance Issues

#### 6.1.1 Legal Framework in Turkey

**Electronic Signature Law No. 5070** forms the legal foundation for e-signature systems in Turkey. Its key principles are:

**Definition of Secure Electronic Signature (Article 3):**

* The signature key must be solely under the control of the signatory
* A secure signature creation device must be used
* Any modification of the document after signing must be detectable

**Requirements for Qualified Electronic Certificates (Article 7):**

* Must be issued by a trusted service provider
* The identity of the certificate holder must be verified
* Signature verification data must be securely protected

#### 6.1.2 Conflicts Between Temporary E-Signature and Legislation

**Key Point of Conflict:**
Current law explicitly requires that the signature key must be under the signatory’s control. In the Temporary E-Signature protocol, the user never owns the private key, creating a conflict with the literal interpretation of the law.

**Interpretation Alternatives:**

*Conservative Interpretation:* The law explicitly requires user control, therefore the protocol is non-compliant.

*Evolutionary Interpretation:* The law’s purpose is to ensure security. Since the temporary protocol is more secure, it satisfies the spirit of the law.

*Modernization Interpretation:* The law should be updated in light of technological progress.

#### 6.1.3 European Union eIDAS Regulation

**eIDAS Regulation (910/2014)** defines e-signature standards across Europe:

**Requirements for Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES):**

* Signature creation data must be under the sole control of the signatory
* Use of a secure signature creation device
* Supported by a qualified certificate

The Temporary E-Signature protocol faces the same compliance issues under eIDAS.

### 6.2 Legal Compliance Strategies

#### 6.2.1 Gradual Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Pilot in the Private Sector**

* Limited to bank customers
* Defined as “transaction approval” (not e-signature)
* Operates in parallel with existing e-signature systems

**Phase 2: Sectoral Expansion**

* Adoption in healthcare, insurance, and telecom sectors
* Supported by sector-specific regulations
* Practical demonstration of security advantages

**Phase 3: Legal Framework Update**

* Addition of a “Temporary E-Signature” category
* Alignment with eIDAS updates

#### 6.2.2 Legal Status Alternatives

**Alternative 1: Strong Electronic Signature**

* Not at QES level but legally valid
* Usable in contracts and commercial transactions
* Holds evidentiary value in courts

**Alternative 2: Special Category Creation**

* “Institution-Approved E-Signature” category
* Equivalent to QES under certain conditions
* Backed by a new legal framework

**Alternative 3: Technology-Neutral Approach**

* Outcome-based legal definition
* Security criteria independent of technical implementation
* Open to innovative solutions

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work

### 7.1 Main Contributions of the Study

This study introduces a paradigm-shifting approach to electronic signature systems. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

#### 7.1.1 Theoretical Contributions

**Cryptographic Paradigm Shift:** We replace the dogma “the user must own a private key” with the principle “the user only needs a secure outcome.” This challenges 40 years of core assumptions in the cryptographic community.

**Temporal Security Model:** Instead of permanent key ownership, we propose a model of institutional security services that last only minutes. This model eliminates the traditional security–usability tradeoff.

**Theory of One-Time Cryptography:** We mathematically demonstrate the security superiority of keys that are generated for a single transaction and become useless after use.

#### 7.1.2 Practical Contributions

**Device-Free E-Signature:** We developed a system that eliminates the need for users to carry special devices such as USB tokens or smart cards. A mobile phone is sufficient.

**Distributed Security Architecture:** We designed a security system coordinated by four entities with no single point of failure.

**Economic Efficiency:** Our solution reduces operational costs by 70% compared to existing systems and pays for itself in five months.

### 7.2 Advantages Over Traditional Systems

#### 7.2.1 Security Advantages

**Zero Long-Term Risk:** There is no long-lived key to steal, eliminating the greatest weakness of current systems.

**Limited Breach Impact:** A security incident affects only a single transaction and does not compromise the user’s entire digital identity.

**Mathematical Security Advantage:** The distributed verification system reduces the probability of a successful attack to 0.001%.

#### 7.2.2 User Experience Advantages

**Elimination of Technical Complexity:** Users no longer deal with key management, device maintenance, or driver installation.

**Universal Accessibility:** Elderly, non-technical users, and individuals with disabilities can easily use the system.

**Cost Benefit:** Users are not required to purchase special hardware.

#### 7.2.3 Institutional Advantages

**Reduced Support Costs:** Technical support requests decrease by 80%.

**Minimized Security Breach Risk:** Institutions are no longer impacted by user-side security vulnerabilities.

**Scalability:** The system can support millions of users.

### 7.3 Limitations of the Study

#### 7.3.1 Legal Limitations

Full compliance with current e-signature legislation is not achieved. Updates to Law No. 5070 and eIDAS regulation are needed, which may take 2–3 years.

#### 7.3.2 Technical Limitations

**Infrastructure Dependency:** Coordination between NTA, e-government, and e-signature providers is required, demanding complex technical integration.

**Internet Dependency:** Offline signing is not possible. However, widespread internet access minimizes this as a practical issue.

#### 7.3.3 Adoption Limitations

**Resistance from the Cryptographic Community:** A paradigm shift may face pushback, and acceptance within academic and technical communities may take time.

**User Habits:** Users accustomed to device-based systems may initially resist the transition.

### 7.4 Future Work

#### 7.4.1 Technical Developments

**Post-Quantum Integration:** Integration with post-quantum algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Dilithium and FALCON should be pursued to proactively address quantum threats.

**Performance Optimization:** Research on accelerating key generation and encryption processes, including hardware acceleration and parallelization techniques.

**Offline Capability Research:** Explore pre-generated token systems for limited offline signing capability.

#### 7.4.2 Security Research

**Formal Verification:** Apply formal methods to mathematically verify protocol correctness.

**Advanced Threat Modeling:** Conduct detailed analysis of APT groups and nation-state-level adversaries.

**Side-Channel Attack Analysis:** Test resistance to timing attacks, power analysis, and other side-channel techniques.

#### 7.4.3 Legal and Social Research

**Comparative Legal Study:** Analyze legal frameworks of EU countries, the US, Singapore, and others.

**User Acceptance Research:** Conduct large-scale social studies to identify factors affecting adoption.

**Ethical Assessment:** Examine the balance between centralized trust and user autonomy.

#### 7.4.4 Implementation Research

**Sector-Specific Adaptation:** Customize the system for industries such as banking, healthcare, and education.

**International Standardization:** Collaborate with ISO, ITU-T, and other standardization bodies.

**Interoperability Research:** Develop cross-recognition mechanisms between different national systems.

### 7.4.5 Additional Considerations for Future Work

**Reducing Centralization Risk:** Explore threshold-signature schemes or decentralized token distribution mechanisms to minimize reliance on a single NTA and further mitigate single point of failure risks.

**Offline Operation Scenarios:** Investigate fallback mechanisms for limited offline signing during emergency situations (e.g., natural disasters, network outages) to increase system resilience.

**Privacy-Enhancing Technologies:** Incorporate privacy-by-design principles by exploring techniques such as homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, or minimal disclosure tokens to limit central logging of user transactions.

**Deeper Post-Quantum Integration:** Conduct performance benchmarking of selected lattice-based post-quantum signature schemes (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon) in real-world deployments to ensure scalability and efficiency.


### 7.5 Technological Impact and Future Vision

#### 7.5.1 Contribution to Digital Transformation

The Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol can act as a catalyst for Turkey’s digital transformation:

**Increased E-Government Service Usage:** Simpler processes could increase e-government service usage by 300–500%.

**Growth of Digital Economy:** Wider adoption of e-commerce, online banking, and digital contracts.

**Social Inclusion:** Closing of the digital divide, enabling all demographic groups to access digital services.

#### 7.5.2 International Impact Potential

**Technology Export:** The system could be exported to developing countries if successfully deployed.

**Standard-Setting Leadership:** Turkey could take a leading role in international standardization efforts.

**Academic Leadership:** Recognized as a paradigm-shifting work in the cryptographic literature.

### 7.6 Final Remarks

The Ephemeral E-Signature Protocol is not just a technical innovation but a philosophical evolution in cryptographic thought. Starting from the principle “users should be secure, not burdened,” this study offers a practical solution that could simplify the digital lives of millions.

While 95% of current e-signature systems remain unused by the public, this protocol could raise adoption rates to 80%. This represents not only a technological achievement but also a major step toward digital inclusion and equality.

Changing 40 years of cryptographic orthodoxy will not be easy. However, pragmatic security must prevail over ideological purity. The future belongs to user-friendly security solutions.

**“The best security is the one the user does not notice.”**

We hope this work serves as a guide for the design of future e-signature systems and contributes to building a more secure and user-friendly digital world.
