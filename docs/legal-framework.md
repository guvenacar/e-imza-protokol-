# Legal & Compliance Considerations

## 1. Current Legal Landscape

- **5070 Electronic Signature Law (Turkey):**
  - Key points: user control of private key, secure signature creation device
- **EU eIDAS Regulation:**
  - Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) requirements

## 2. Compatibility Analysis

- ✅ Compliance areas (where protocol already matches legal requirements)
- ⚠️ Conflict areas (where interpretation or legal updates may be required)

## 3. Recommended Legal Updates

- Suggested amendment to Law 5070 (adding "temporary e-signature" definition)
- Alignment with eIDAS for EU cross-recognition

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

- Pilot deployment under current legal framework
- Gradual introduction of legal amendments
- Stakeholder engagement plan (government, CA providers, regulators)
